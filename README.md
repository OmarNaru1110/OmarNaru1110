# Omar Elnaggar
I love building systems that actually scale, solving tough backend problems, and learning how things work under the hood.  
Currently deep in .NET and Go.

## Things I’ve built
* **Aggar** – a vehicle rental platform with real-time chat, secure payments, and automated booking flows.  
  > Designed to scale and built to actually solve a problem.
* **Yaqra** – a book-centered social platform for readers and discussions.  
  > Focused on meaningful engagement and efficient backend design.

## What keeps me curious
Computer science fundamentals, distributed systems, clean architecture, performance tuning, and anything that makes me ask *“how does this actually work?”*

## Currently learning
Nginx.

## Outside of code
I love nature, quiet places, and someday hope to visit Mount Fuji.  
Balancing deep work with peaceful moments keeps me grounded.

## To recruiters
Please check my pinned projects — they tell my story better than a list of buzzwords.  
But since you asked:  
.net, go, c++, ef core, dapper, grpc, websockets, rabbitmq, docker, sql server, mongodb, ci/cd with github actions, microservices, unit testing, problem-solving, teamwork, and curiosity.
